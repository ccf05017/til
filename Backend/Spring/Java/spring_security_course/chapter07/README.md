# Chapter 07: Advanced Authentication


## Section Details

Although username and password authentication is extremely common, as we discussed in
Chapter 1, Anatomy of an Unsafe Application, and in Chapter 2, Getting Started with Spring
Security, forms of authentication exist that allow users to present different types of
credentials. Spring Security caters to these requirements as well. In this chapter, we'll move
beyond form-based authentication to explore authentication using trusted client-side
certificates.

During the course of this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
> * Learning how client certificate authentication is negotiated between the user's browser and a compliant server
> * Configuring Spring Security to authenticate users with client certificates
> * Understanding the architecture of client certificate authentication in Spring Security
> * Exploring advanced configuration options related to client certificate authentication
> * Reviewing pros, cons, and common troubleshooting steps when dealing with client certificate authentication
