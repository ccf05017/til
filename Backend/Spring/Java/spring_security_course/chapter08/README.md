# Chapter 08: Spring Social with OAuth2


## Section Details

OAuth 2 is a very popular form of trusted identity management that allows users to
manage their identity through a single trusted provider. This convenient feature provides
users with the security of storing their password and personal information with the trusted
OAuth2 providers, optionally disclosing personal information upon request. Additionally,
the OAuth 2-enabled website offers the confidence that the users providing OAuth 2
credentials are who they say they are.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
> * Learning to set up your own OAuth 2 application in less than 5 minutes
> * Configuring the EventManager application with a very rapid implementation of OAuth 2
> * Learning the conceptual architecture of OAuth 2 and how it provides your site with trustworthy user access
> * Implementing OAuth 2-based user registration
> * Experimenting with OAuth2 attribute exchange for user profile functionality
> * Demonstrating how we can trigger automatic authentication to the previous OAuth 2 providers
> * Examining the security offered by OAuth 2-based login
