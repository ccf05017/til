# Chapter 06.03
## Remember-Me Services
### Persistent remember-me configuration
Spring Security provides the capability to alter the method for validating the remember-me
cookie by leveraging different implementations of the RememberMeServices interface. In
this section, we will discuss how we can use persistent remember-me tokens using a
database, and how this can increase the security of our application.

## Tasks

### Add Persistent remember-me configuration

> * Add remember-me configuration in [SecurityConfig.java](src/main/java/io/baselogic/springsecurity/configuration/SecurityConfig.java)
> * Add remember-me configuration in [login.html](src/main/resources/templates/login.html)
