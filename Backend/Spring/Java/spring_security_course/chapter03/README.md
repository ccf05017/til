# Chapter 03: Custom Authentication


## Section Details
In this section, we'll explore how to solve some common, real-world problems
by extending Spring Security's authentication support to use our existing set of APIs.
Through this exploration, we'll get an understanding of each of the building blocks
that Spring Security uses in order to authenticate users.



During the course of this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

* Discovering how to obtain the details of the currently logged-in user
* Adding the ability to log in after creating a new account has been created
* Learning the simplest method for indicating to Spring Security, that a user is authenticated
* Creating custom UserDetailsService and AuthenticationProvider implementations that properly decouple the rest of the application from Spring Security
* Adding domain-based authentication to demonstrate how to authenticate with more than just a username and password
